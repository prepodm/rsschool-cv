**********
    I have a dream: Find my favorite activity in this world.
    I have been going towards my dream for almost five years, persistently trying something new. 
    I studied to be a laboratory diagnostician, veterinarian, child psychologist, 
    worked in a charity foundation and in a protestant church with children.
    In University I practiced pedagogy at a children's summer camp.
    Moved to Poland, learned Polish, and faced the fact that inevitably, at different stages of my life, 
    come to the conclusion that I want to learn how to develop web applications.
    And now I'm studying Front-end development.
    I really like to learn something new, and hope to achieve success in this.
